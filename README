Relay! (Codenamed 'Rel√©')
Welcome to the wonderful world of relay. :) 

There's a lot that needs to be done before the initial release. 
I would like basic-tablike-completion like in all IRC clients.
Updating of channels modes needs to be fixed, + need to refresh user list modes after mode changes.
Built in server selection list. 
Create the on-connect commands controller.
Finish the RCChannelManager. // just fixes left.
Handle INVITEs properly. 
Show topic when rejoining a channel
Add option to disable chat autocapitalization
Select chan when you /privmsg /query, /join, etc.
stuffs.
