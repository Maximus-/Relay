Relay! (Codenamed 'Rel√©')
Welcome to the wonderful world of relay. :) 

There's a lot that needs to be done before the initial release. 
I would like basic-tablike-completion like in all IRC clients.
Implement a message count/highlight count in the RCPopoverWindow's table view.
Updating of channels modes needs to be fixed, + need to refresh user list modes after mode changes.
Fix /command system.
Fix rotation of RCPopoverWindow.
Select previously selected channel when a different network is selected via RCPopoverWindow
Implement pulsuing title bar to specify that there are new messages/highlights/etc.
Built in server selection list. 
Create the on-connect commands controller.
Finish the RCChannelManager.
Maybe setup some kind of singleton for commands.
Handle INVITEs properly. 
Show topic when rejoining a channel
Channel/user list scrolling breaks after rotating
Add option to disable chat autocapitalization
Scroll to channel/user window when you /join or /privmsg
There is some weird bug with scrolling at the channel scroll view where the RCChannelBubble will have a bad y placed.
