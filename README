Relay! (Codenamed 'Rel√©')
Welcome to the wonderful world of relay. :) 

There's a lot that needs to be done before the initial release.
RCMessage needs to be overhauled, into some sort of CATextLayer subclass. 
This will be done so that text rendering is efficient and usable. 
We need to implement some sort of link support i think we will do with some math + UIButtons.
I'm clueless of how we would approach copy/paste support, but will keep thinking.
I would like basic-tablike-completion like in all IRC clients.
Implement a message count/highlight count in the RCPopoverWindow's table view.
Updating of channels modes needs to be fixed, + need to refresh user list modes after mode changes.
Fix password storing in the keychain.
Add support for channels with passwords
Fix /command system.
Fix rotation of RCPopoverWindow.
Select previously selected channel when a different network is selected via RCPopoverWindow
Implement pulsuing title bar to specify that there are new messages/highlights/etc.
Built in server selection list. 
Create the on-connect commands controller.
Finish the RCChannelManager.
Maybe setup some kind of singleton for commands.
Handle INVITEs properly.
