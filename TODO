	TO DO
===============

Reload all user lists/something more efficient in RCChannel
Probably move all command loading systems to a singleton class to make the stack happy
Fix the strange occurrences of when things don't appear, but exist. like channel bubbles every once in a while
Fix the text field not appearing on joins (it's just the background image, if you rotate it fixes)
Fix the popover rotation bugs, left orientation works fine, and portrait normal. Everything else is fucky.
Add the new message/highlight bubbles to the RCPopoverWindow table view
FIX THE KEYCHAIN SO IT CAN SAVE PASSWORDS !!!! !!!!!! !!! !!! !! !!! !!!
Fix the scrolling bugs in the RCChatPanel like when the user is scrolling and a new message is displayed, etc.
Improve table view scrolling drastically. (Involved NSMutableAttributedString attribute crap most likely.)
Fix most of the stuff in the RCAddNetworkController, like the done button being disabled/enabled. (Behavior changes from simulator to device)
Fix the channel manager, it shouldn't add the channels until the user clicks the done button.
When the user does /join, it should immediately add the channel bubble, and then wait for the server response?
Fix the text field looking disabled until someone interacts for some odd reason. It's only disabled when the channel is not joined etc.
Fix some small stupid rotation bugs.
Reload table views after rotation so cells don't look fucked up
When the user selects a different network from the popover, it should select the channel he was previously on.
Save scroll position somehow so when you return to a channel it's at the same position you were previously at.
Vibrate on push notifications.
Setup pulsing bar concept surenix made.
Add support for channels with passwords! !! !!  (!IMPORTANT!)
(The above also requires the keychain to work)
