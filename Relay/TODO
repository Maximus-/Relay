     TO DO
===============

RCChannel:: {
	For user listing for the channel, we are only given the users current and highest modeset. If they lose this mode, and have another mode that's of less value, we will never know unless we reload the entire user list. We're going to have to do this on some sort of refresh timer or something so we aren't constantly polling the server for this information.
	When user requests to join a channel, immediately tell the UI to join the channel, then enable the text field once it is successful (Maybe even post a YOUR_NICK_HERE joined the channel, or post an error, password request, etc (Still unsure of this entire design)).
	On push notification, when the notification is posted, make sound + vibrate.
	Add support in the infodictionary stuff for the join-on-connect channels, etc. 
	Add support for channels with passwords. 
}
Commands:: {
	Having instances of classes that have huge method lists could hurt the stack/slow things down, so instead let's have one singleton class in memory always that can just handle and return values or something to each network? Maybe some sort of queue? The only bad things about this, is that if one command is slow, costly, etc, other commands won't happen until that one is finished. But then again, what user is doing /ipod /sysinfo /this /that, constantly? fr0st maybe. So meh.
}
User-Interface:: {
	The input text field in the main chat view, sometimes does not appear on creation of the chat panel. It's technically touchable, and you can select it, and then you will see it, but you will never know it is there. It is invisible. I think this is due to my shitty threading. This same bug is occuring with the channel bubbles in the channel bar. 
}
RCPopoverWindow:: {
	Rotates to left-landscape and portrait-normal just fine. When you rotate to any other direction it turns the wrong direction/etc. Small fixes are necessary. Small bug where the table view is above the popover image sometimes. It's rare though. 
	Implement the new message count/highlight count bubbles that go in the table view for each network. If the network isn't connected, don't show any. (If it was connected, and now disconnected, still show them. Expected behavior)
	When network is selected, select the channel it was previously on. Default to "IRC".
}
Keychain:: {
	Actually store passwords.
}

RCChatPanel:: {
	When posting new messages and the user is scrolling, it sometimes glitches, expected. We need to not scroll to new messages while the user is scrolling, simple as that. And not fuck up everything else in the process.
	Smoothen out scrolling in the table view. aka fix the _textHasBeenSet method with some sort of caching or arrays/dictionaries/meh. If we do this, scrolling will be nice.
	If the user rotates the app, the other panels will not reloadData, so when you go to a different panel, the text labels may extend over the cell and look fucky until scrolling.
	When user selects channel, have the same scrolling position active that they were previously at.
}

RCAddNetworkController:: {
	Finish this up, add the on-connect commands section, other nicks, channel setup for password protected channels, (STORING PASSWORDS), etc.
}

RCNavigator:: {
	The chat panel is not rotated properly every once in a while, should actively check rotation or something. When it is dismissed, it may choose the wrong orientation. Probably very easy to fix.
}

I-WILL-EXPLAIN-THIS-LATER:: {
	Setup pulsing bar concept surenix made.
}
